# Data Science Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the end-to-end data science pipeline for the Financial Fraud Detection project, emphasizing the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase and ensuring alignment with business objectives and technical feasibility.

## Pipeline Phases

### 1. Data Collection and Understanding
- **Data Sources**
  - Raw transaction data from internal banking database (`data/raw/dataset.csv`)
  - Transaction types: PAYMENT, TRANSFER, CASH_OUT, CASH_IN, DEBIT
  - Features: transaction amounts, sender/receiver balances, timestamps
  - Sourcing logistics: Extracted via secure API; complies with GDPR and financial regulations

- **Data Quality Assessment**
  - Initial data loading and validation
  - Missing value analysis
  - Duplicate detection
  - Data type verification
  - Compliance check: Ensure anonymization of sensitive fields (e.g., customer IDs)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### 2.1 Guiding Questions
- Are certain transaction types (e.g., CASH_OUT) more prone to fraud?
- Do fraudulent transactions exhibit distinct temporal or balance patterns?
- Which features correlate most strongly with fraud?

#### 2.2 Univariate Analysis
- **Numerical Features**
  - Distribution analysis (histograms, box plots)
  - Central tendency (mean, median, mode)
  - Spread measures (standard deviation, IQR)
  - Outlier detection (e.g., Z-score, IQR method)

- **Categorical Features**
  - Value counts and frequencies
  - Bar charts and pie charts
  - Category distribution analysis

#### 2.3 Bivariate Analysis
- **Feature-Target Relationships**
  - Correlation analysis with fraud labels (Pearson, Spearman)
  - Feature importance ranking (e.g., via Random Forest)
  - Statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square for categorical vs. fraud)

- **Feature-Feature Relationships**
  - Correlation matrices (heatmap visualization)
  - Scatter plots for numerical pairs
  - Cross-tabulation for categorical pairs

#### 2.4 Time Series Analysis
- **Temporal Patterns**
  - Transaction frequency over time
  - Fraud rate trends (daily, weekly)
  - Seasonal patterns (e.g., holiday spikes)
  - Time-based feature engineering (e.g., hour of day, time since last transaction)
  - Anomaly detection for fraud spikes

### 3. Data Preprocessing

#### 3.1 Data Cleaning
- Missing value imputation (e.g., median for numerical, mode for categorical)
- Outlier treatment (e.g., capping, removal)
- Duplicate removal
- Data type conversion (e.g., timestamps to datetime)

#### 3.2 Feature Engineering
- **Derived Features**
  - Balance changes (pre- and post-transaction)
  - Transaction amount-to-balance ratios
  - Time-based features (e.g., transaction frequency per account)
  - Risk scores (e.g., based on historical fraud patterns)

- **Feature Transformation**
  - Categorical encoding (OneHotEncoder for transaction types)
  - Numerical scaling (StandardScaler)
  - Feature selection (e.g., based on correlation, importance)

#### 3.3 Data Splitting
- Train/Validation/Test split (70/15/15)
- Stratification to preserve fraud/non-fraud ratio
- Cross-validation setup (5-fold)

### 4. Model Development

#### 4.1 Model Selection
- **Candidate Algorithms**
  - Random Forest, XGBoost (robust to imbalance)
  - Isolation Forest (anomaly detection)
  - Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Selection criteria:
  - Data characteristics (imbalanced, temporal)
  - Problem type (binary classification)
  - Class imbalance handling (e.g., SMOTE, class weights)

#### 4.2 Model Training
- Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
- Cross-validation for robustness
- Class imbalance techniques: SMOTE, undersampling, or cost-sensitive learning
- Evaluation metrics: Prioritize Recall (minimize missed frauds), F1-score, ROC-AUC

#### 4.3 Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC
  - Confusion matrix (focus on false negatives)
- Model interpretability (e.g., SHAP values)
- Feature importance analysis
- Business impact: Estimate cost savings from fraud prevention

### 5. Model Deployment

#### 5.1 Model Serving
- API development (FastAPI)
- Model serialization (e.g., pickle, joblib)
- Inference pipeline for real-time predictions
- Scalability: Deploy on cloud (e.g., AWS) with load balancing

#### 5.2 Monitoring and Maintenance
- Performance monitoring (e.g., latency, accuracy)
- Data drift detection (e.g., feature distribution shifts)
- Model retraining triggers (e.g., fraud rate changes)
- Version control (Git, MLflow)
- KPIs: Prediction latency, fraud detection rate

## Current Implementation Status

   - Document insights in report

2. **Model Development**
   - Finalize algorithm selection (e.g., XGBoost)
   - Apply class imbalance techniques (e.g., SMOTE)
   - Optimize for Recall and F1-score

3. **Deployment Preparation**

## Best Practices

1. **Data Quality**
   - Regular validation checks
   - Automated quality scripts
   - Data lineage tracking

2. **Code Quality**
   - Modular design with functions/classes
   - Unit tests for preprocessing and models
   - Inline comments and docstrings

3. **Model Management**
   - Version control for models and data
   - Performance tracking over time

4. **Security**
   - Data encryption (e.g., AES-256)
   - Role-based access control
   - Audit logging for all predictions

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Risk**: Model overfitting to training data
   - **Mitigation**: Use cross-validation, regularization (e.g., L2 penalty)

2. **Risk**: Data drift due to changing fraud patterns
   - **Mitigation**: Implement drift detection, retrain periodically

3. **Risk**: Regulatory non-compliance
   - **Mitigation**: Consult legal team, anonymize PII, document compliance

4. **Risk**: High false negative rate (missed frauds)
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize Recall, use ensemble methods
