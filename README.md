# Financial Fraud Detection System

A production-ready machine learning system for detecting fraudulent financial transactions. This system combines advanced machine learning techniques with scalable architecture to provide real-time fraud detection capabilities.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive fraud detection system that can:
- Process and analyze financial transactions in real-time
- Detect potentially fraudulent activities using ensemble machine learning models
- Provide detailed analytics and reporting
- Scale for production workloads

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker (optional)
- Supabase account (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finance_fraud_detection.git
cd finance_fraud_detection
```

2. Set up environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configurations
```
